Changed the type hints for ``z_mean`` in `plasmapy.formulary.collisions`
functions from ``astropy.units.dimensionless_unscaled`` to
`~numbers.Real`. Consequently, ``z_mean`` will no longer be processed by
`~plasmapy.utils.decorators.validators.validate_quantities`. Previously,
``z_mean`` issued a warning when a real number was provided instead of a
dimensionless |Quantity|.
